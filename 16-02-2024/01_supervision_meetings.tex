        \begin{myitemize}
            \item The Pi Cam recording script should record in raw format without any compression to eliminate artefacting.
            \item Better test footage is required to continue work on the simple bubble detection script.
            \item I mentioned that I will be prioritising the initial report this week due to nearing deadline, working on hardware/software is a time sinkhole.
