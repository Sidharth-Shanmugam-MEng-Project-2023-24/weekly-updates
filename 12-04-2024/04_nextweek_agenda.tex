\subsubsection{Monday - Reach milestone V1}

Actionable Items:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All that needs completion is logic to implement logic to track real time metrics. This needs to be ported over to the codebase from my prototyping code.
\end{itemize}

Success Metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code pushed to the git repository.
\end{itemize}








\subsubsection{Friday - Reach milestone V2}

Actionable Items:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The V1 system uses Canny to detect edges, with the detected edges passed to OpenCV's findContours() method to extract closed loop edges. The cancellation logic then uses a minimum enclosing circle (MEC) implementation which calculates a circumcircle which completely covers the minimum area of the detected contour. The MEC implementation must be replaced with the snake method.
    \item The `least distance rule' and Kalman filter approach must be researched for the backscatter tracking implementation in the system.
\end{itemize}

Success Metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code pushed to the git repository.
\end{itemize}
