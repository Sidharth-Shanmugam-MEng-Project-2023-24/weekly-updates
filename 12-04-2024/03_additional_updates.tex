\subsubsection{Laptop Issues}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In the last update on Friday, I mentioned that the laptop had been given to a repair centre to fix the flexgate issue and it would be back by that Sunday.
    \item It took them an entire week for them to get to open up the laptop housing, and another few days of diagnosis just for them to get back and say that the entire display unit needs to be replaced :-(.
    \item I ended up collecting my laptop back without any repairs done to it, I am managing with external monitors and of course my iPad which I'm using to mirror my laptop screen using Sidecar.
    \item I have spoken to a few repair centres near York, one in York and one in Bradford that are offering a service to repair the cable itself - apparently they cut the cable where it's damaged, and solder in a small section of a similar donor cable. This will add a few millimeters of flex cable length to ensure this issue will not happen again in the future.
    \item Hopefully the issue will be fixed by Monday. I'm so glad I added in the two weeks of buffer time in the Gantt schedule for this as this issue has caused so many delays.
