\subsubsection{Recording underwater footage from the ISA tank}

Progress Report:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The housing is now sealed up correctly, the Pi is accessible via SSH through Ethernet, and my Pi Camera recording script works perfectly. The live preview feed is extremely useful especially when trying to apply fine adjustments to the camera (focus/aperture).
\end{itemize}

Pending Tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item There are still some health and safety/other administrative issues that must be resolved before using the ISA tank. Once this has been completely checked-off, I should have access to record footage.
\end{itemize}
