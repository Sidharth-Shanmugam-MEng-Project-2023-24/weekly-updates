        Preliminary research &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Read about each of the 4 objectives, make notes on the technical aspects that would be required for each in project journal.
        \end{myitemize} &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Make notes in project journal, discuss during the next supervision meeting.

        Next supervision meeting &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Next supervision meeting to take place on Thurs 9th Nov @ 2pm at the ISA (Paul Mitchell to send calendar invite).
            \item As discussed in the last virtual supervision meeting, after seeing the lighting system it'll be easier to decide which avenue I want to research.
            \item Since the next meeting is at the ISA I may get a tour of the facilities. I can learn about the tools I'll have at my disposal for this project.
        \end{myitemize} &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Not very easy to generate measurable success metrics for these items.
            \item Decide on one of the 4 objectives.
            \item Make notes on useful facilities for this project at the ISA in project journal.
