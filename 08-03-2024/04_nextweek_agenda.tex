        Script to record footage from RPi and Pi GS camera. &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item During this week, I've been able to record in un-encoded raw format. I need to find a way to parse this data to view the footage.
            \item If I can't get this working, then I already have a failsafe in place - logic to record with MJPEG encoding with zero lossy compression.

            \item With the script to record footage completed, I can then use the facilities at the ISA to record test footage.

            \item Need to research ways to accurately record real-time metrics in Python.
            \item Need to research which metrics are important for this project and must implement in software.
