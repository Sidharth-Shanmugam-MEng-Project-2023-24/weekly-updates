        Experiement with Canny edge detection for bubble detection &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item \textit{Not a priority, try to make a start if possible.}
            \item Best starting point is to use the paper that the two papers I read this week cited for the technicalities of how Canny can be employed.
            \item Once I understand the technicalities, I can then experiment with bubble detection using Python, OpenCV, and the bubble test images that I had extracted/produced.
