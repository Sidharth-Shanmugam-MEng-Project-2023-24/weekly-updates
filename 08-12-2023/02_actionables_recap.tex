        Expand research and make notes. & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item There's one paper that discusses the technical aspects of using Canny to detect bubbles, this will be read next.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I need to read more literature - there was one that was cited by both the papers I read, and it should go into greater depth of how Canny was employed to detect bubbles. I will be reading this next.

        Experiement with Canny edge detection for bubble detection & 
        \textit{No progress on this.} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Unfortunately, I could not find time to play around with this.
