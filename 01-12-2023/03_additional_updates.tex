        Obese Project Journal & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item The Project Journal document is starting to get really big (currently just under 20MB) and the project hasn't even properly started yet.
            \item It doesn't seem like a great idea having a singular file that is growing at this rate in a Git repository (GitHub has file size limits which I may quickly reach).
            \item I explored a few tools I could use to help solve this:
            \item \LaTeX: I can separate one document into multiple files, which can be imported into a singular file to reder a PDF. But it's not quick enough to be able to jot down progress.
            \item Markdown: Very simple and great for jotting progress quickly. But, features are sparse, you cannot import multiple files into a singular file to render, cannot easily create references/bibliography tables, etc.
            \item Dendron: a Markdown based note-taking app that is a Visual Studio Code extension. Packed with useful features, but a nightmare to work with - not easy to use at all.
            \item I need to figure out a better tool.
