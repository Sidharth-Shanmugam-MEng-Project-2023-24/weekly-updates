        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Start researching on blob detection algorithms
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I have listed a few academic papers related to underwater bubble detection, mostly from IEEE.
            \item The two textbooks that I'd checked out of the library don't relate much to the project, I will keep them just in case for supplementary information.
            \item I've struggled to find textbooks that goes into detail on these aspects.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I plan to read the papers, making notes in the Project Journals on each.
            \item I will read any referenced papers/textbooks that are related to the project.
        \end{myitemize} \\

        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Gather literature for object tracking/predicting movement
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I have gathered some papers on underwater object tracking.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I will be making notes, and expanding my literature collection by exploring the referenced papers.
            \item I am prioritising research on blob detection at the moment.

        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Experiment with blob detection algorithms
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I have made some prototype code to help with my blob detection research in Python using OpenCV.
            \item Using various filters, I have been successful in detecting most of the bubbles in the test image inputs.
            \item All progress on this has been logged in the Project Journal.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Fine tune blob detection parameters and test with non-bubble backscatter.
            \item Maybe even apply some of the algorithms discussed in the research papers.
