        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Discussed real-time software research findings.
            \item Tour of the ISA, desk assignment.
            \item Meetings to happen bi-weekly in person until next semester. Will be in touch with Paul \& Ben for any project updates.
            \item Discussion about hypervisors with Ben. Using Docker to package script and assign CPU/hardware, potentially solving OS scheduling issues.
            \item I've shown interest in the `improving real-time computing' aspects of the project. May have some aspects of underwater testing using facilities.
            \item Rewriting software in C to reduce the overheads introduced by Python.
            \item Paul \& Ben mentioned to start simple with the software logic - with simple thresholding - then fine tuning to improve accuracy.
            \item Ben mentioed to read older literature (e.g. 2010-era) on digital image processing - since there wont be any added complexities such as computational intelligence/ML/AI.
            \item Work can be done to research the performance of different algorithms to detect and eliminate backscatter.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Ben will send me some underwater footage to help me test any code without needing to implement in hardware and physically test.
            \item I will ask Ben to send me the existing Python code so that I can get it set up on my Raspberry Pi.
            \item With some underwater footage, I can modify the existing Python code to stream the video from file instead of from a camera, I can try to experiment with hypervisors (Docker) to see differences in performance. If there is an improvement, I will implement Docker in my final code.
            \item I will try to research digital image processing from \textit{older} literature.
            \item I will try experiment with running C programs on Raspberry Pi.
