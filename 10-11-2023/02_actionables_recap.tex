            \item Next meeting in person to see existing lighting system. After seeing the existing system, I can decide the avenue I'd like to pursue.

        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I have shown interest to delve into the `improving real-time computing' avenue.
            \item I have seen the existing lighting system, and have received a tour of the ISA.

        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Carry out some rough preliminary research for the 4 potential objectives: improving real-time computing, underwater testing, backscatter depth perception, ML-based backscatter position tracking.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Initial research into `improving real-time computing' has been conducted with some reading into real-time software (documented in the Project Journal).
            \item I have not conducted any research on the other 3 objectives since those avenues would probably not be pursued.
            \item Underwater testing aspects may need to be researched, however, not any time soon.
        \end{myitemize} &
