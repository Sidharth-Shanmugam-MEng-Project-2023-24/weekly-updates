        Experimentation with hypervisors &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Get existing Python code and some underwater GoPro footage from Ben.
            \item Modify the existing Python code to stream the video from file instead of from a camera.
            \item Package the software with Docker, measure performance differences.
        \end{myitemize} &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Modified code should be working and containerised with Docker.
            \item Make notes in project journal, discuss during the next supervision meeting.
        \end{myitemize} &
        Friday \\
        \hline
        Gather some digital image processing literature &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Since this is quite early on and I have other modules to focus on this semester, I won't be going into too much depth with the literature.
            \item So this actionable item would be to simply gather a list of potential pieces of literature that I could read in depth at a later date.
            \item I should be making some brief notes on the contents.
        \end{myitemize} &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Log the brief notes in the Project Journal, citing the sources of the literature.
        \end{myitemize} &
        Friday \\
        \hline
        Experiment with RPi and C &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Make simple scripts in C and run on Raspberry Pi.
            \item Set up a simple-yet-efficient workflow that can speed up development time in preparation for when I start writing the project software.
        \end{myitemize} &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Log progress in the Project Journal, maybe even store code in a `spike' repository on Github.
        \end{myitemize} &
        Friday \\
