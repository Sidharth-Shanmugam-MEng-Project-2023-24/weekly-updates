        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Experiment with hypervisors
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Underwater GoPro footage with backscatter has been received.
            \item Existing code has been retrieved, had to extract the files from the Pi's SD card.
            \item Will be shifting this task for later so that I can produce software beforehand.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item \textit{No pending tasks.}
        \end{myitemize} \\
        \hline
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Gather some digital image processing literature
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I have gathered two textbooks for digital image processing.
            \item Didn't get a chance to read through them yet, but will be doing so for next week.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Log the different algorithms and complexities for each.
        \end{myitemize} \\
        \hline
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Experiment with RPi and C programming
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I've researched that C programming would be quite difficult for this task.
            \item Instead of C I could use C++.
            \item A lot of the online resources suggested prototyping in Python, then translating to C++ for production.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Set up C++ workflow to develop and deploy to Raspberry Pi.
        \end{myitemize} \\
