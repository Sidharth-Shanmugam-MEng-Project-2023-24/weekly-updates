\subsubsection{Demo went quite well.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item My project attracted a surprising amount of attention from a lot of visitors, who were mostly staff, for example, Phil Lightfoot, who is an avid diver, was extremely impressed with the project.
    \item Unfortunately, we didn't have many external visitors, albeit from the three who visited my room and saw the project, one asked me to pose next to the project demonstration and poster and took a picture of me, which I found was quite funny as I'm not sure where that picture of me has ended up. Despite including big QR codes in my project poster linking to my project initial report, personal CV, and LinkedIn, I don't think anyone was interested enough to scan them :(.
    \item A piece of feedback that I'd like to give to the department is: invite more external people from industry to these demonstration days! Browsing around at other projects by my peers, I found many to be exceptional despite not being given any interest by the visitors. It all feels like a wasted effort when there isn't anyone to demo your project to. Also, by inviting more people, there would be more recognition of the university, which is great for business!
