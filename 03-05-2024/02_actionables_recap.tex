\subsubsection{Parallax and offset calibration}

Progress Report:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No progress was made for this actionable item due to the lack of time within this project.
    \item As I mentioned in last week's update, this actionable item consists of extremely complicated aspects that would ideally require many weeks to research, develop, and implement, not just for software, but also for the hardware construction of the submersible to mitigate as much offset as possible.
    \item I will be skipping this task, however, it is something I will be writing about in my final report as future work.
\end{itemize}

Pending Tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{None.}
\end{itemize}




\subsubsection{Snake-based segmentation \& tracking}

Progress Report:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No progress was made for this actionable item due to the lack of time within this project.
    \item I did consider whether it is really necessary to implement a snake-based segmentation logic since my standard Canny + minimum enclosing circle method works extremely effectively due to minimal computational intensity and simplicity. However, a minimum enclosing circle will result in some of the non-backscatter regions being unlit due to the circle estimation, which can be resolved by accurately wrapping the projected `holes' perfectly around the backscatter outline.
    \item Sadly, due to the severe lack of time, and efforts being shifted to the final report, I will not be implementing this or the tracking feature, entirely skipping software Milestone V2. Although, I will surely write about this in my final report as future work.
\end{itemize}

Pending Tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{None.}
\end{itemize}






\subsubsection{Complete the `Introduction' section of my report}

Progress Report:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Although not yet pushed to the GitHub repository, I have completed this section.
    \item I have also completed around two-thirds of the next section `Background Information'
\end{itemize}

Pending Tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I will aim to complete the `Background Information' section completely to produce the first drafts of this and the `Introduction' sections for review by Ben.
\end{itemize}
