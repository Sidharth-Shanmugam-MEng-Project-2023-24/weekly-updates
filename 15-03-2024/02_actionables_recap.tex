        Script to record footage from RPi and Pi GS camera. & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item The RPi implementation of MJPEG isn't zero lossy.
            \item I have a better understanding of how the raw data is captured, this should help with parsing and playback.
            \item Recording in raw format will be challenging due to insufficient boot drive write speeds.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I need to fine-tune the recording logic to use RAM for buffering instead of writing directly to the boot drive.
            \item I need to write a view script that parses the raw data to play back the video recording.
        \end{myitemize} \\
        \hline
        Record test footage. & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Unfortunately, the seal for making the housing water-tight didn't set in time, so recording has been postponed.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Once the seal has cured, Ben will record the footage for me using the script.
            \item I need to send him instructions on how to use the program.
        \end{myitemize} \\
        \hline
        Research real-time metrics and implement in backscatter cancellation software. &
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item No progress on this due to the backlog of other tasks.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I will shift this for next week.
