\subsubsection{Skipping the predictive system objective.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Unfortunately, due to very tight project time constraints, I will not have enough time to work on this research objective. It's a shame that I have to skip this, as I was very interested in researching how AI can accelerate unconventional use cases such as this.
    \item I will be focusing more on quantifying the real-time aspects and researching optimisations for more accurate backscatter segmentation and cancellation.
