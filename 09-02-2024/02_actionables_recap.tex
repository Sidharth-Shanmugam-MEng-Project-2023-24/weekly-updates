        More research into PREEMPT-RT and reading into how the bubble region was determined and filled with white from the paper. & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item All progress complete for this item, and logged into the proejct journal.
            \item The paper doesn't go into much detail on how the bubble region was segmented after applying Canny.

        Write benchmark script. & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item A simple script with bubble detection with Canny and segmentation with contour detection is complete, albeit very inaccurate.
        \end{myitemize} & 
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item I will need to record better test footage to work with for fine-tuning the script before I can improve the bubble segmentation logic and implement bubble tracking and position predictions.

        Plan initial report & plan schedule. & 
        \begin{myitemize}

        \begin{myitemize}
            \item Due to running to a lot of software and hardware issues, I ended up with this task in backlog. The software and hardwre problems have been mostly resolved, so I can make an effort on this next week.
